# Fullstack To-Do App

## Overview

This To-Do app combines a NestJS backend with TypeGraphQL, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL for the server-side, providing API endpoints to manage tasks. The frontend is built using Flutter, offering a user-friendly interface to interact with the to-do list.

## Features

### Backend (NestJS, TypeGraphQL, TypeORM, PostgreSQL)

- **GraphQL API**: Access and manage tasks via GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **TypeORM**: Object-Relational Mapping for seamless database interactions.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Store tasks and related data persistently.

### Frontend (Flutter)

- **User Interface**: Intuitive and responsive design for task management.
- **Task Creation & Management**: Add, update, delete tasks.
- **Real-time Sync**: Real-time synchronization with the backend.
